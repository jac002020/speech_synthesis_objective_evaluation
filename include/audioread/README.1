Audioread
http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/matlab/audioread/

audioread provides a single, unified Matlab function for 
reading audio files in a range of different file formats, 
including wav, mp3, aac, flac, AIFF, etc. In most cases, 
access is actually provided by external binaries, but this is 
hidden within audioread (and its subfunctions). The idea is 
to make your code independent of the kind of audio files used 
as input.
